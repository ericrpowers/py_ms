This will house the strategy/logic needed to solve Minesweeper automatically. The current thought process is the following:
* 1) Identify all safe moves and mines based on immediate neighbors
* 2) Identify all safe moves based on known mines
* 3) Identify all safe moves by using neighbors' info
* 4) Identify least risky move
* 5) Blind click if no other options are found
